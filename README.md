Module 20 Challenge


## Credit Risk Analysis Report

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of a logistic regression model in predicting the credit risk associated with loans. Specifically, the model aims to classify loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1). This analysis is critical for the company to make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, thereby minimizing the financial risk and potential losses associated with high-risk loans.

### Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the logistic regression model is 99%. This means that 99% of the total predictions made by the model are correct.
- Precision:
    - For healthy loans (0): 1.00
    - For high-risk loans (1): 0.85
- Recall:
    - For healthy loans (0): 0.99
    - For high-risk loans (1): 0.91
- F1-Score:
    - For healthy loans (0): 1.00
    - For high-risk loans (1): 0.88

### Summary and Recommendation
The logistic regression model demonstrates exceptional performance in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans, as evidenced by high accuracy (99%), high precision (1.00) and recall (0.99) for healthy loans, and balanced performance for high-risk loans by precision of (0.85) and recall of (0.91). The model successfully identifies a significant portion of high-risk loans while maintaining a reasonable balance between precision and recall, as reflected in the F1-score of 0.88. Given these metrics, the logistic regression model is recommended for use by the company due to the high predictive accuracy that ensures that the model will make reliable predictions and effective risk identification where the model successfully flags most high-risk loans, helping to minimize potential financial losses.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the logistic regression model's strong performance across these metrics makes it a valuable tool for the company. It can significantly improve the decision-making process, ensuring financial stability and efficient operations.
